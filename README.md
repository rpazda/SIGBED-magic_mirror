# SIGBED-magic_mirror
SIGBED magic mirror project for Fall 2016

The purpose of this project was to create a "magic mirror", a mirror with built in data display capabilities. To facilitate this the team decided to build a simple, high-contrast UI as a web page that could be displayed on monitor within the mirror.

##Application Structure
The main components of the application are an HTML file (mirror.html) and a JavaScript file (mirror.js). The HTML file lays out the structure of the UI and important elements while the JavaScript page gets data and gives it to the HTML to display.
